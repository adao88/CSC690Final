# CSC690Final
CSC 690 Final Project

Proposal:
Legalization of recreational use of marijuana makes it easily accessible for
anyone above the legal age of 21 to consume and purchase marijuana. With over 100 different strains, it's not easy for people to pick a strain and assume they're going to be happy with. Weed is so diverse and people should be able to know what they're purchasing before hand.  There's definitely been many times when people have gotten way too stoned or didn't like it.  Because of this, we thought it would be great for regulars and newcomers to be able to easily inquire information on the type of marijuana strains they are purchasing. Things like the effects, the medical benefits, and of course the negatives.
